# Bikeshare
i am used python programming language to make bike share systems of three major cities â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. I used code to compute statistics. when user need to filter data by choosing specific city,month and day system created to get main information in few line of code  about rent bikes. 

Dataset 

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. The data files contain the same core six columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also provide the following two columns:
